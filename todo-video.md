## üéØ Priority Features for Next Implementation

Based on common use cases, these should be prioritized:

1. **Video trimming/cutting** - Essential for basic editing
2. **Progress tracking** - Critical for user experience
3. **Multi-quality outputs** - Important for streaming
4. **Audio extraction** - Frequently requested
5. **Watermarking** - Important for branding

---

## üìù Notes

- All features should include comprehensive error handling
- Each feature should be properly documented
- API endpoints should be added to Postman collection
- Unit tests should be written for each feature
- Performance benchmarks should be recorded
- Security implications should be considered

## üîß Technical Considerations

- **Memory Management**: Implement streaming for large files
- **Disk Space**: Automatic cleanup of temporary files
- **Concurrency**: Limit simultaneous processing jobs
- **Timeouts**: Set appropriate timeouts for long operations
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging
- **Monitoring**: Integration with monitoring tools (Sentry, DataDog)
